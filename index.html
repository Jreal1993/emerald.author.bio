            <p class="travelText">Emerald has a huge passion for travel. She hopes to make it to all the states, and every continent. 
                She used to work for an airline, so she was traveling every week for several years. 
                She hopes to continue to travel as often as she can in the future.

            <p class="tinyHouseText">Emerald is originally from Alaska, and she still has a tiny house on her property. 
                She is able to use this to visit her family and have a place to stay. When she is not visiting, other 
                family members use this house as a place to stay when they come home. She originally did not want to 
                have the tiny house put on her property, but her mom suckered her in by building it as a tiny replica 
                of her Nona’s house. Even using the same front door and windows.

            <p class="readingText">Emerald is somewhat of a book dragon, having a TBR a mile long. 
                Her favorite books are: City of Bones by Cassanadra Clare. Uglies by Scott Westerfeild, 
                and Pride and Prejudice by  Jane Austen. She has been an avid reader since she was a young 
                child, with her mother reading her books such as all the Dr. Seuss books, and The Borrowers. 
                She passed that love of reading on to her niece, reading books to her when she was little, 
                and buddy reading when she grew older.
